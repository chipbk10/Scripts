### XCRUN
```
xcrun simctl erase all                                    # to erase and reset all simulators

xcrun simctl shutdown F3-3ED6-4E10-                       # to shutdown a simulator

xcrun instruments -w F3-3ED6-4E10- -t Blank               # to run any simulator by GUID:
xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/your.app             # to install app to the booted simulator
xcrun simctl uninstall booted /path/to/your.app           # to remove app from the booted simulator
xcrun simctl launch booted "com.app.bundleIdentifier"     # to launch the app in the booted simulator

### Carthage

````
touch Cartfile                                            # create Carthage file, then add dependencies
Cartfile.resolved                                         # this file contains info about versions of the dependencies, should be stored in the repository
````

#### Carthage directory
- Build 		# built frameworks
- Checkouts 	# source code

#### Notes
- Carthage maintains its own internal cache (database) of dependency repositories, 
- so it doesnâ€™t have to clone the same source multiple times for different projects.

````
carthage update                                           # clone the repositories (dependencies), then build each dependency into a framework
carthage update --platform iOS
carthage bootstrap --no-build                             # Carthage skip download the binary builds
````

#### bootstrap vs update
````
carthage bootstrap 					  # checkout & build
carthage update 					  # update & re-build
````
